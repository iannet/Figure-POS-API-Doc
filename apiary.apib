# Figure Point of Sales API

This API can be used for creating point of sales applications powered by the Figure platform.

## Headers

There are 2 HTTP Headers used by the point of sales API:

+ Content-Type
+ X-Auth-Token

The *Content-Type* header is a standard header and should be set to application/json for all requests.

The *X-Auth-Token* header is used to authenticate with the API server. The Auth Token is obtained by logging into the application using the *Authenticate User* and *Get Account Auth Token* API methods.

## Authentication

There are 3 endpoints used for authenticating with the API:

+ <a href='#reference/account/account/authenticate-user'>Authenticate User</a>
+ <a href='#reference/account/account/authenticate-user-2-factor-auth'>Authenticate User 2 Factor Auth</a>
+ <a href='#reference/account/account/get-account-auth-token'>Get Account Auth Token</a>

#### Authenticate User

The <a href='#reference/account/account/authenticate-user'>*Authenticate User*</a> method allows authentication provided a valid administrator username and password. Along with basic profile information this method returns a *Ticket* which can be used with the method <a href='#reference/account/account/get-account-auth-token'>*Get Account Auth Token*</a> to obtain an *Auth Token* which can be passed in the *X-Auth-Token* Header to allow API access for an account. If you already know what account you want to access you can do this in a single step by supplying the account you wish to access as well using the optional *account* field.

#### 2 Factor Authentication

The <a href='#reference/account/account/authenticate-user-2-factor-auth'>*Authenticate User 2 Factor Auth*</a> method allows authentication for administrators who have optionaly enabled the 2 Factor Auth feature. If 2FA is enabled then the response from <a href='#reference/account/account/authenticate-user'>*Authenticate User*</a> will have the 2FA "Token" and an additional field "require_2fa" which will be set to 1. The 2FA Token along with the 2FA Code that was sent directly to the administrator can be sumitted using <a href='#reference/account/account/authenticate-user-2-factor-auth'>*Authenticate User 2 Factor Auth*</a> to complete the Authentication process and return an Authentication Ticket which can be supplied to <a href='#reference/account/account/get-account-auth-token'>*Get Account Auth Token*</a>.

#### Get Account Auth Token

The <a href='#reference/account/account/get-account-auth-token'>*Get Account Auth Token*</a> method takes an Authentication Ticket supplied by the <a href='#reference/account/account/authenticate-user'>*Authenticate User*</a> method and an account you wish to access and returns an Auth Token that can be passed in the *X-Auth-Token* header to allow access to an account via the API.

## Cart API

Populating customer carts and placing orders is facilitated by the <a href='https://securecheckout.docs.apiary.io'>*Figure Commerce API*</a>. The *Cart API* can be accessed using the same *X-Auth-Token* for the account obtained from the <a href='#reference/account/account/get-account-auth-token'>*Get Account Auth Token*</a>. The *X-Session-Id* for a customer can be obtained by passing the customer id to the *Create Admin Cart Session* method. This allows a cart to be created for a customer without knowledge of the customer password.

finest new and used oak for 18 months, then bottled and cellared for an additional 24 months deep in the heart of our century-old cave system, this wine is redolent of black fruit with a hint of spice
